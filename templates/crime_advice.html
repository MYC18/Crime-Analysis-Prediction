  <button class="accordion">Theft from a person</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      Don’t leave your phone, iPad, tablet, or camera unattended, out of your sight or left on a table.
    <br>
      <br>
      Always be aware of your mobile and your whereabouts and act accordingly. And when you have finished using it, put it away.
    <br>
      <br>
      Use your device’s security features, applications or PIN locking mechanisms to protect your data and prevent the phone being used if stolen.
    <br>
      <br>
      Track it. Consider installing a tracker application on your mobile phone. They are readily available online. If your mobile’s ever stolen, act promptly.
    <br>
    <br>
      It’s a good idea to scan the area around ATMs before you use them. Be aware of anyone standing close by and always check the machine to see if it has been tampered with before using it.
    <br>
      <br>
      Beware of ATM frauds. Things to look out for are devices attached to the machine. If you do see something suspicious contact the police and the bank.
    <br>
      <br>
      Thieves will watch as you key in your PIN or distract you while you are withdrawing cash. Be vigilant. Cover your PIN and always keep an eye on your card. If someone taps you on the shoulder or tries to speak to you, just ignore them. After leaving the ATM, put your card right away.
