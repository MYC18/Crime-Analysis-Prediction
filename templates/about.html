                            <p>
                                After studying marketing Melissa Yasmina Chauffour worked as a search engine optimization analyst and discovered her interest in coding.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She chose the University of Birmingham to do her MSc in Computer Science. It is in the context of her studies that she is creating this web application.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Passioned about crime since a young age, Melissa chose to focus on the crime rate in the West Midlands as her MSc dissertation subject.

                            <p>
                                The data comes from data.police.uk which is a site for open data about crime and policing in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

                                We concentrated our efforts on the West Midlands region and its four police forces:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            <li>Staffordshire Police</li>
                            <li>Warwickshire Police</li>
                            <li>West Mercia Police</li>
                            <li>West Midlands Police</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Two datasets were used, street-level crime and stop and search between January 2011 and March 2021.
